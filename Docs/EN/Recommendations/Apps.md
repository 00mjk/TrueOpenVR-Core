# Recommendations for creating VR applications
Recommendations to make applications more convenient to use.

## Interface
It is desirable that the application has two windows, the main window with the program for the VR display and the second small window located on the desktop of the conventional display (not VR), with the ability to close the application and, possibly, some more functions.

## Optimization
The app should work at least 60 frames with a resolution of 1920 to 1080 on the current system requirements TrueOpenVR.


Current requirements are not required for VR players.

## System requirements
* Processor Intel Core i3 2120 or equivalent AMD

* Graphics Nvidia GTX 660 2 GB or AMD Radeon 7850 2 GB

* 4 GB of RAM

Such requirements allow you to get a modern level of graphics and at the same time cover the largest number of gaming computers.


System requirements are based on [Steam equipment user statistics](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) and are revised after the release of a new generation of Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox consoles.


Such requirements are necessary for the growth of VR popularity.
