# Recommendations for creating VR applications
Recommendations to make games more comfortable for players.

## Interface
It is desirable that the application has two windows, a main window with a game for the VR display and a second small window located on the desktop of a conventional display (not a VR), with the ability to close the application and possibly some more functions.

## Control
The game should use teleporters and movements with a stick.


Teleporters should be activated by pressing the "Trigger" button (on the left controller), "Grip" (on the left controller) or by pressing the stick (on the left controller). After clicking, the selection to the teleportation location is activated. When the button is released, the player teleports.

Movement in the game must be jerky. Move the player through the left stick or move in real space. The player himself decides that it is more convenient for him. Someone prefers to play sitting someone standing, someone has a large room and someone has a small room and so on.

Rotate the camera, left and right you can do with the right stick in addition to the usual rotation of the head. This approach will avoid discomfort in some players, and some are simply more convenient to rotate in this way. Other players may not use the right stick and rotate as usual.

In addition to VR controllers the player should be able to play on the usual gamepad.


For left-handers, it is necessary to provide for the exchange of the functional buttons of the left and right controller.
## Interaction
Objects for interaction should be located at arm's length. This approach allows you to play in a sitting position.

To take objects in hands can use the "Grip" button.
